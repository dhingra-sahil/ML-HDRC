    "\n",
    "Many models were run and compared using different combinations of data pre-processing techniques, degrees of feature selection, and hyperparameter tunes. This section outlines the experiments and interprets their results. The main challenge of this section was developing models which could *actually* run and would not crash the python kernel. The computational cost of these algorithms is a common theme and will be revisited often in discussion.\n",

    "## Pre-Processing Techniques\n",

    "### Feature Engineering\n",

    "\n",
    "When aggregated, the dataset is very large, approximately 2.5 gb of space. When reading these data in as-is, the large memory required to work with the dataset made it a cumbersome object on which to operate ML pipelines. The `reduce_mem_usage()` function is used immediately upon data read-in to counter this large memory requirement. Where possible, this function changes a given column's default datatype to a datatype with a smaller memory footprint. For example, an `int64` column composed of only 1s and 0s (IE OHE columns...) might be converted to an `int8` column with no data loss, and significant memory reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This operation typically led to a ~70% memory size reduction of the imported dataset making it much easier to work with. The function is provided below with an example output. Credit to the publisher: https://pythonsimplified.com/how-to-handle-large-datasets-in-python-with-pandas/\n",

    "### Collinearity Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "During Phase 2 exploratory data anlysis, multicollinearity between input variables was shown to be prevalent in most of the data tables. Multicollinearity was further increased during the aggregation process as numeric input variables were proliferated into their mean, median, variance counterparts (amongst other aggregation types). This introduction of new (possibly) redundant variables to the ML algorithms significantly increases computation time and often reduces algorithm accuracy/effectiveness. \n",
    "\n",
    "Used in conjunction with the `DataframeSelector()` transformer class, the `CollinearityReducer()` transformer class combats multicollinearity by removing the *most* (multi-) collinear columns which are *least* correlated to the target variable. The algorithm steps are described below: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given input variable *X* and target variable *y*, calculate the correlation matrix\n",
    "2. Pivot the correlation matrix into a long dataframe of correlation pairs and values (input variable 1, input variable 2, absolute correlation) and drop the following variable pairs:\n",
    "   + any pair including the target variable\n",
    "   + any pair with two of the same input variable\n",
    "   + any pair with an absolute correlation value below a specified threshold value (default is 0.5)\n",
    "3. For each variable pair, compare to see which variable is *more* correlated to the target variable. These input variables are given a 'win' while the input variable in the pair which is *less* correlated to the target variable is given a 'loss'. \n",
    "4. Count the total 'wins' and 'losses' for each variable and drop from the original dataframe any variable with 0 wins. \n",
    "5. Repeat steps 1 to 4 until there are no more input variable pairs with correlations above the threshold, no more input variables scoring 0 wins, or the specified maximum number of iterations has been reached. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `CollinearityReducer()` thus applies a common multicollinearity solution - drop the variable which is least correlated to the target (Introduction to Statistical Learning Chapter 3). This is no simple task for human to perform on a high-dimensional dataset, but this class provides a mechanical solution so it does not have to be done manually. the `transform` method of this class creates a list of attribute names from the original dataframe which are *to be kept* - multicollinear classes culled by the `CollinearityReducer()` are *not* included in the output. This output list is then used as the input for the `DataframeSelector()` class in the pipeline. Thus, the `CollinearityReducer()` selects columns based only on the training data and there is no leakage from the validation or test data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, this algorithm is only applied to numerical variables as it is assumed there should natrually be some elevated degree of collinearity between one-hot-encoded categorical variables. Furthermore, the algorithm should be applied to numerical data which has been subjected to the same scaling and imputation strategy as applied in the actual pipeline. \n",

    "### Nonparametric Model Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonparametric classification models (as opposed to *parametric* classification models like logistic regression) do not rely on underlying assumptions on our dataset. This can be useful for high dimensional data. Decision Tree (\"DT\") models build trees of binary decisions by which to classify values in a feature space into its target classifications. Used in ensemble (many trees used together), these models can be very powerful! In this project, we explore two types of nonparametric models to compare and tune: *Random Forest* DT models and *Gradient Boosted* DT models.\n",
    "\n",
    "> + In **Random Forest Models**, the trees are grown independently on random samples of the observations. However, each split on each tree is performed using a random subset of the features, thereby decorrelating the trees, and leading to a more thorough exploration of model space relative to bagging. This algorithm combines the output of multiple (randomly created) Decision Trees to generate the final output.  In this algorithm, each node in the decision tree is grown based on a random subset of features and subset of the input features.\n",
    "> + In **Gradient Boosted Models**, we only use the original data, and do not draw any random samples. The trees are grown successively, using a “slow” learning approach: each new tree is fit to the signal that is left over from the earlier trees, and shrunken down before it is used. These trees incrementally added to an ensemble by training each new instance to emphasize the training instances previously mis-modeled.\n",
